Guidelines for Effective Meetings
---------------------------------

(Partially from Bush, MIT M.Sc. Thesis, 1998)
---------------------------------------------

_Meeting Organization_

*   Facilitator
    *   Agenda
    *   Keeps Rules
    *   Avoids Domination
    *   Keeps Time
*   Record Keeper
    *   Takes Notes
    *   Distributes Notes
*   Rotate Roles!
*   Running a Meeting: See Separate Handout

_Beginning_

*   Start meetings on time and hold them in a place where the group won't be distracted or interrupted.
*   Come to meetings prepared.
*   Assign someone in the group to prepare an agenda before each meeting to be finalized and agreed upon in the first few minutes of the meeting.

_Speaking_

*   In speaking, the most important thing to aim for is balance. Try to balance the input of each member.
*   To maximize the group's collective wisdom, seek to hear from everyone.
*   As a group, appoint a leader during each meeting to notice who is speaking and who is not and to invite the comments of those who are silent.
*   Encourage each other to speak for no more than 2 minutes at a time unless a group member has a report to give.
*   Individually try to find a place where you are not monopolizing nor withdrawing from the conversation at hand.
*   When you do speak, try to be honest, courteous, and to the point regarding your own work and the work and ideas of others.
*   Avoid interrupting and side conversations; one conversation at a time is plenty, while three or four concurrent conversations make it impossible to go anywhere collectively.
*   Stories whether about basketball games or political farce, should probably be saved for other forums.

_Listening_

*   View listening as more important than speaking.
*   Listen well enough to be able to paraphrase what is said.

_Giving/Receiving Feedback_

*   Give feedback to each other in non-threatening supportive ways (a good way to do this is to focus on the group goals and how a particular issue assists group objectives without attacking any group member).
*   Seek feedback from each other, because it is most often useful even if disconcerting.  
    Expect to disagree with each other.
*   Do not personalize disagreement; instead, try to learn from it.
*   Acknowledge as a group that wisdom and information can come from many different sources: facts, feelings, hunches, opinions, ideas, mistakes, and even silence.
*   Seek to maximize the information you obtain from each other in your meetings through asking questions.

_Decision-making_

*   Be careful with the decision-making process. Once a decision has been made, it is very difficult and painful to backtrack.
*   Be patient with the process of shaping consensus; make sure everyone agrees with a decision before moving on. One member's disagreement is a liability to group effectiveness.
*   Make sure you hear and address all sides of an issue.
*   If necessary, go through several iterations of analyzing alternatives, eliminating the most obvious, re-analyzing, eliminating, etc.
*   If the decision-making process is not handled with care, a decision will probably have to be rethought at a later date after unneeded headache and work.

_Assess Group Interaction_

*   Once a week discuss what goes well/not well re. group work.

_Ending_

*   End meetings on time.
*   Make significant progress towards the goal of a meeting before ending.
*   Whenever these two objectives conflict, be sure to discuss why significant progress was not achieved and whether to continue or meet another time.
*   Summarize what the meeting accomplished.
*   Set the date and time of your next meeting, the possible agenda, and any necessary preparations or tasks.

Indicators of Successful Teamwork in Industry
---------------------------------------------

_Hensey, 1992_

*   Obtaining the opinions and involvement of other group members in issues that concern them before making final decisions.
*   Being willing to help team members even when inconvenient or requires extra effort.
*   Voluntarily offering relevant experiences, ideas, and findings to team members.
*   Making timely contribution to someone else's action plan or project when requested.
*   Acknowledging a colleague's contribution to a project when working with a client or senior manager, sharing the credit.
*   Being non-defensive and receptive to the suggestions, ideas, opinions, and needs of colleagues; making effort to understand before criticizing.
*   Considering impact your plans and actions will have on others.
*   Being unwilling to criticize third party who is not present, not gossiping.
*   Coming prepared to present or participate when you have a role to play in meetings.
*   Expressing appreciation for teamwork extended to you and your people that was helpful.
*   Identifying and helping to pick up loose ends even though they may not be in your area of responsibility.
*   Keeping people advised of changes and developments and new information on a task or project.
*   Being supportive of team's objectives once they are set, rather than sabotaging, fault-finding, or being negative behind the scenes.
*   Pitching in when the whole team needs help in meeting a deadline or solving a problem, even if it's "not your job".
*   Trusting the team to develop consensus on an issue, even if it takes a little more time.
