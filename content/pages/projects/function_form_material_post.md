Task 3 - Assessment
-------------------

_Task 3A: Function - Form - Material_

Describe from memory how you developed your paperweight design.

Are form and function related in your design? If so, how?

Did the difference of materials play a role in your design regarding form, regarding function, regarding both?

_Task 3B: Production_

Building paperweights by gluing pieces together is probably not the most cost effective way. Put yourself in the position of a paperweight factory owner who wants to have a raw material (building blocks) that can be assembled in a variety of forms. This includes the contradictory requirements:

*   Minimize Expensive Labor such as Machining of Complex Shapes (Skilled Labor Cost)
*   Minimize the Number of Assembly Steps (Labor Cost)
*   Produce Many Different Forms

Draw an influence diagram for this decision making process. An influence diagram shows the relation of different factors reflecting a process (manufacturing or construction) and is used as a basis for analyzing a process. We will show you how to construct such influence diagrams.
